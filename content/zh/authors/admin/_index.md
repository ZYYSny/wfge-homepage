I am a pre-tenured associate professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University and the director of <span style="color: #0cc977; font-weight: bold;">Nebula AI Group (NAIG)</span>. Before I joined Fudan, I got a PhD degree in computer science from the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Professor Yizhou Yu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/). I received a MS degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University at 2015 and a BS degree in optical information science and technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology at 2012.

<span style="color: #0cc977; font-weight: bold;">NAIG</span> focuses on developing edge-cutting theories and technologies in AI. Our team works on three sub-research areas, including visual recognition and interpretable deep learning, protein structure prediction, and service robots with self-awareness.

- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;">Visual Recognition and Intepretable Deep Learning:</span> We study metric learning, weakly supervised learning, few-shot learning, meta learning and their applications with computer vision. Our goal is building learning systems capable of understanding our visual world.
- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;">Protein Structure Prediction and Drug Discovery:</span> We study deep learning methods to infer the 3-D structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences. We aim to predict the binding properties of drug molecules and proteins to identify potential new medicines.
- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;">Robots with Self-awareness and Cognitive Intelligence:</span> Enabling self-awareness in autonomous intelligent systems is essential for artificial general intelligence (AGI). Our team focuses on developing cognitive theories and technologies for self-evaluation and meta reasoning in humanoid robots.
